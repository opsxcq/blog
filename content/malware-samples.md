All content is encrypted for your safety and to avoid being censored on GitHub,
to import the GPG key `66ED4A9A4D70D36FE48196419AD730FE9CDE5661`.

{{< highlight bash >}}
curl -sq https://github.com/opsxcq.gpg | gpg --import
{{< /highlight >}}

And then decrypt it:

{{< highlight bash >}}
gpg --decrypt Win32Disassembler.exe.gpg > output
{{< /highlight >}}

If the key is not trusted, the message bellow is shown but this doesn't
interfere with the normal workflow. But consider trusting the key to avoid these
warnings.
