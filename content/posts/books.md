Bellow a curated list of books which I consumed in the recent past years, which
my thoughts on them.


## Machine Learning and Data Science books {#machine-learning-and-data-science-books}


### TensorFlow for deep learning : from linear regression to reinforcement learning (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">Ramsundar and Zadeh 2018</a>) {#tensorflow-for-deep-learning-from-linear-regression-to-reinforcement-learning}

Overall is a subpar _hello world_ kind of book for `Tensorflow`, nothing but the
basics. Chapter 8 on _Reinforcement Learning_ has some nice examples which are
easy to be understood.


### Hands-On Neural Networks with TensorFlow 2.0: Understand TensorFlow, from static graph to eager execution, and design neural networks (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Galeone 2019</a>) {#hands-on-neural-networks-with-tensorflow-2-dot-0-understand-tensorflow-from-static-graph-to-eager-execution-and-design-neural-networks}

Is a book from _Packt_ but besides the bad reputation from this publisher, the
books is quite good, it touches some more practical subjects, as how to convert
a model to `Tensorflow.js` and some practical examples of using _Generative
Adversarial Networks_. Besides other _Packt_ books where chapters usually don't
maintain a context or narrative in between them, this book focus solely on image
related problems.


## Security {#security}


### Bug Bounty Hunting Essentials : Quick-paced guide to help white-hat hackers get through bug bounty programs (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">Lozano and Amir 2018</a>) {#bug-bounty-hunting-essentials-quick-paced-guide-to-help-white-hat-hackers-get-through-bug-bounty-programs}

Chapter on _Basics of Bug Bounty Hunting_ can be skipped, just generic information
which you could do better by reading the official information of the platform of
your choice. The chapter _How to Write a Bug Bounty Report_ lacks real content and
better examples.

The only interesting point about the book starts on the chapters dedicated to
specific vulnerabilities, in which are discussed in details some vulnerabilities
found on famous services, like _Uber, Shopify, Binary.com_ among others.


## Electronics {#electronics}


### Programming with MicroPython : embedded programming with microcontrollers and Python (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_4">Tollervey 2017</a>) {#programming-with-micropython-embedded-programming-with-microcontrollers-and-python}

Very high level view, basically a book with some _hello world_ examples which
didn't add any value. Lacks the full view and workflow of using such devices, it
focused mostly on `micro:bit`.
