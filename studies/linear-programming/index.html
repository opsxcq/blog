<h1>Linear Programming</h1>
</header>
<div class=content__body>
<p><strong>Linear programming</strong> is a mathematical method to achieve the best result for a
given problem. This problem is expressed through a mathematical model which
represents the real world problem. Also called <strong>linear optimization</strong> because of
it&rsquo;s essence to optimize a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function><em>linear objective function</em></a>.</p>
<p>In other words, linear programming aim to find the optimal input value for the
function, value which will also be the optimal solution for the problem. Usually
linear optimization is a good method to solve <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem>assignment problems</a> which are a
fundamental kind of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization>combinatorial optimization problems</a>. Assignment (or
allocation) problems are basically the kind of problem that asks for the
allocation of scarce resources. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scheduling problems;</li>
<li>Resourcing problems;</li>
<li>Assignment problems;</li>
<li>Balance your meals to fit your macro nutrient goals;</li>
<li>Sudoku.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the first example is focused on explaining the concepts, the second
example will be solved using a more straight forward solution without giving
redundant explanations.</p>
<h2 id=example-problem-1>Example problem 1</h2>
<p>To make things more concrete, I will present an example and solve it. Let&rsquo;s
suppose that a certain farmer wants to know which cereal to cultivate in his
farm. Let&rsquo;s suppose that the farmer can grow only 2 kinds of cereals, <em>corn</em> and
<em>beans</em>. And the farmers main objective is the maximum profit. The farm has 100
acres, each acre of <em>corn</em> result in 8 sacks while each acre of <em>beans</em> result in 10
sacks. For planting of each acre of <em>corn</em> it is needed 3 hours of work, while for
each acre of <em>beans</em> 2 hours of work are needed. The farmer has 240 hours of work
available but it costs 200$ for every hour. The maximum demand is limited by the
market at a maximum of <em>480 sacks of corn</em> sold by 150$ each and <em>800 sacks of
beans</em> sold by 120$ each. Which cereal should the farmer grow to have the maximum
profit ?</p>
<h3 id=problem-modeling>Problem modeling</h3>
<p>To model the problem, we need to extract the 3 main characteristics of the
problem, determine the variables, determine it&rsquo;s restrictions and calculate the
objective function.</p>
<h4 id=variables>Variables</h4>
<p>Variables are everything that you can work on the problem, they are the moving
parts and the input of the <em>objective function</em>.</p>
<p>In the case of the proposed problem we have two variables, acres of <em>corn</em> and
<em>beans</em> that will be cultivated. For brevity, let&rsquo;s call <em>corn</em> \(x\) and <em>beans</em> \(y\).</p>
<h4 id=objective-function>Objective function</h4>
<p>It shows our target function to archive, it can be a <strong>maximization</strong> or
<strong>minimization</strong> of the result of the function \(Z\), or in very rare cases, the
objective is to approximate \(Z\) to a certain value. The objective function is
created to reflect the impact of the variables on the outcome. In other words,
based on the variable values, it output has to represent the outcome in the real
world.</p>
<p>For the objective function of the example case above, the main objective is
<strong>maximum profit</strong>, it means to maximize the output of the function that given the
amount of <em>corn</em> and <em>beans</em> calculate the profit. We can define what profit is by
the \(Profit = Sell Price - Costs\).</p>
<p>So:</p>
<p>\[ Z(x,y) = (150 \times 8 \times x) + (120 \times 10 \times y) - (200 \times 3 \times x) - (200 \times 2 \times y) \]</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break it down in some chunks and analyse it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount of money obtained for each acre of <em>corn</em> (named \(x\)) grown: \((150 \times 8 \times x)\)</li>
<li>The amount of money obtained for each acre of <em>beans</em> (named \(y\)) grown: \((120 \times 10 \times y)\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we subtract the costs of cultivating those crops, considering that each
work hour costs \(200\) dollars:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of cultivating one acre of <em>corn</em> \((200 \times 3 \times x)\)</li>
<li>The cost of cultivating one acre of <em>beans</em> \((200 \times 2 \times y)\)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can optimize it by writing:</p>
<p>\[ Z(x,y) = (1200 \times x) + (1200 \times y) - (600 \times x) - (400
\times y) \]</p>
<p>And again:</p>
<p>\[ Z(x,y) = (600 \times x) + (800 \times y)\]</p>
<h4 id=restrictions>Restrictions</h4>
<p>Restrictions are any restriction that we need to apply to our variables. The
amount of resources, time, effort, etc&mldr; One common restriction considering
cases where we are applying linear programming to production is the <strong>non
negativity</strong> rule, it means, you can&rsquo;t produce -1 cars, all numbers of cars
produced must be positive or no car produced at all (zero cars).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The maximization or minimization of the function \(Z\) will always end up with on
restriction limiting it&rsquo;s result. So you can analyse that restriction and
determine the bottleneck of your function. In case of all restrictions being
reached it means that there was no bottleneck and all resources were utilized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the example problem we have some restrictions, it will be listed bellow:</p>
<ul>
<li>100 acres available, it means \(x+y \leq 100\)</li>
<li>The market demand for <em>corn</em> \(8x \leq 480\)</li>
<li>The market demand for <em>beans</em> \(10y \leq 800\)</li>
<li>The labour limitation defined by $ 3x + 2y ≤ 240$</li>
<li>And finally, the non negativity rule, that give us \(x \geq 0\) and \(y \geq 0\)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=100-acres-available>100 acres available</h4>
<p>Since we are calculating with our variables \(x\) and \(y\) being the acres
cultivated, they directly represent it, so no transformation is needed.</p>
<h4 id=the-market-demand-for-corn>The market demand for <em>corn</em></h4>
<p>We are using acres as our base value, the demand of <em>corn</em> is represented as the
amount of \(x\) times how many sacks of <em>corn</em> each acre produces: \(8x \leq 480\)</p>
<h4 id=the-market-demand-for-beans>The market demand for <em>beans</em></h4>
<p>We are using acres as our base value, the demand of <em>beans</em> is represented as the
amount of \(y\) times how many sacks of <em>beans</em> each acre produces: \(10y \leq 800\)</p>
<h4 id=the-labour-limitation>The labour limitation</h4>
<p>The same logic applies here, since we are using acres as our base value, we
multiply the labor needed for each acre of each cereal, it means that <em>corn</em> needs
\(3\) hours of labor, and <em>beans</em> need \(2\) hours.</p>
<h2 id=solving-by-hand-with-graphical-method>Solving by hand with graphical method</h2>
<p>We will apply the graphical solution here where the limitations are plotted so
is possible to determine the solution visually. Bellow is the result of the
above restrictions plotted in a graph.</p>
<h4 id=plot-the-graph>Plot the graph</h4>
<p>For all restrictions listed above, we will create a table with two lines, one
for the restriction result for the smallest value of \(x\) and the maximization of
the value \(y\), and the other for the opposite. As you can see, if there is only
one variable in the restriction the table is not needed, since we are looking
for the maximization of the use, it will result only on a straight line in the
graph. In the example case the limitations of the market can be seen in the
graph as perpendicular lines across their axis.</p>
<p>Since we are trying to maximize the resource usage, we remove the \(\leq\) and
replace it with an equal symbol.</p>
<p>For the labour time restriction \(3x + 2y = 240\)</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>X</th>
<th>Y</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>120</td>

<tr>
<td>80</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It means that for this restriction you will draw a line from the point \((0,120)\)
to the point \((80,0)\). The are bellow the line, which for all elements there
this function is true, is called <strong>feasible region</strong>.</p>
<p>The second restriction is pretty straight forward, we will analyse the total
available area for the crops, which is given by the \(x+y = 100\).</p>
<table>
<thead>

</table>
<p>It means that you will draw a line from the point \((0,100)\) to the point
\((100,0)\).</p>
<p>The market demand for production of <em>corn</em> \(8x = 480\), that gives us \(x=60\). The
market demand for production of <em>beans</em> \(10x = 800\), that gives us \(y=80\). Both
will be represented by a straight line each on the given point.</p>
<p>With those restrictions calculated we can have some idea of the dimension of the
graph that we are going to plot. Since our max value for \(y\) is 120 (labour
restriction) and for \(x\) is 100 (total available area). Also adding a little bit
of interpretation to this graph, we can tell that if we only grow corn crops, we
won&rsquo;t be able to use all land that the farmer have, since the bottleneck in this
case will be the labor available.</p>
<p>Here is what the graph should look like after it is plotted.</p>

<p>Colored in <strong>orange</strong> the 100 acres available, it means \(x+y \leq 100\)</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=intersection-points>Intersection points</h4>
<p>After plotting the restriction functions we have what is called <strong>feasible region</strong>,
a region of the graph that give possible solutions for our problem based on the
restrictions only. The second step is to determine which point in this region
maximizes or minimizes the result for the objective function \(Z\).</p>
<p>The essence of this method is to create a visual analysis of those points of
intersection which are called <strong>corner points</strong>. If the problem has a solution, this
solution will be one of those corner points.</p>
<p>In the example we have <strong>5 intersection points</strong>, they will be presented based on
which restriction they intersect or 0, to make things easier to reference later,
we will name those points with letters.</p>
<ul>
<li>A) 0 and <strong>demand for beans</strong>;</li>
<li>B) <strong>demand for beans</strong> and <strong>available area</strong>;</li>
<li>C) <strong>available area</strong> and <strong>available labor</strong>;</li>
<li>D) <strong>available labor</strong> and <strong>demand for corn</strong></li>
<li>E) <strong>demand for corn</strong> and 0;</li>
</ul>
<p>Next step is to compile a table with all points and their values or \(x\) and \(y\).
But to be able to work with that we need to solve the equations to know their
values at their intersection point.</p>
<p>Points <strong>A</strong> and <strong>E</strong> won&rsquo;t require any special effort since they have a know value in
one of their axis.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Point B</p>
<p>Point <strong>B</strong> is the intersection between the demand of beans \(y=80\) and the available
area \(x+y \leq 100\). So we just solve the system</p>
<p>\[ x + y = 100 \]</p>
<p>Replacing \(y\) with it&rsquo;s value.</p>
<p>\[ x + 80 = 100 \]</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>\[ x = 100 - 80 \]</p>
<p>It gives us the point \(x=20\) and \(y=80\) \((20,80)\).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Point C</p>
<p>Point <strong>C</strong> is the intersection between the available labor \(3x+2y \leq 240\) and the
available area \(x+y \leq 100\). So we just solve the system</p>
<p>\[ 3x+2y = 240 \]</p>
<p>\[ x+y = 100 \]</p>
<p>We need to isolate one factor, so let&rsquo;s isolate \(y\) in the second
equation.</p>
<p>\[ x+y = 100 (\times -2) \]</p>
<p>And making one big equation we will have</p>
<p>\[ 3x +2y -2x -2y = 240 - 200 \]</p>
<p>\[ x = 40 \]</p>
<p>Now that we have the \(x\) value, we just need to replace it in any of
this two equations and we will have the \(y\) value for that point.</p>
<p>\[ 40+y=100 \]</p>
<p>\[ y=60 \]</p>
<p>It gives us the point \(x=40\) and \(y=60\) \((40,60)\).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Point D</p>
<p>Point <strong>D</strong> is the intersection between the available labor \(3x+2y \leq 240\) and the
demand for corn \(x=60\). So we just solve the system by replacing \(x\)</p>
<p>\[ 180 + 2y = 240 \]</p>
<p>\[ 2y = 240 - 180 \]</p>
<p>\[ y = 30 \]</p>
<p>It gives us the point \(y=30\) and \(x=60\) \((60,30)\).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Corner points table</p>
<p>Now that all points are calculated, just replace the \(x\) and \(y\) symbols by
their values on the table bellow and calculate the objective function with it.
It will give the output for those variables, and using this output if our
objective is to maximize the result of the function, we will take the biggest
value on the table as the optimal value, if the objective is to minimize, we
take the smallest, simple as that.</p>
<p>Given the objective function</p>
<p>\[ Z(x,y) = (600 \times x) + (800 \times y)\]</p>

<h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Based on the table in the last section we can determine that the <strong>optimal</strong> area
for the maximization of the profit is <strong>20 acres of corn</strong> and <strong>80 acres of beans</strong>,
which will give a <strong>profit of 76000$</strong>.</p>
<p>This is enough, but we can look further and determine the bottlenecks, in other
words, what is limiting the maximization of the objective function. In this
example, this is a point of the analysis that gives the answer about what should
be worked on to improve the profit.</p>
<h4 id=bottleneck-analysis>Bottleneck analysis</h4>
<p>To determine which restrictions are limiting the objective function, just
analyse the values of \(x\) and \(y\), if restrictions match the value it means that
this restriction is limiting the best outcome.</p>
<p>Applying our example</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Available area</p>
<p>All available area was used, since \[ 20+80 = 100 \]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Demand for corn</p>
<p>The market demand for corn was not met, it means that if more corn was produced,
it would be sold.</p>
<p>\[ 8 \times 20 \leq 480 \]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Demand for beans</p>
<p>The market demand for beans was met, it means that even if more beans were
produced, they won&rsquo;t be sold and won&rsquo;t generate any profit.</p>
<p>\[10 \times 80 = 800\]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Labor limitation</p>
<p>Still 20 hours of labor remaining after all the production, it can be determined
by:</p>
<p>\[ 3 \times 20 + 2 \times 80 \leq 240 \]</p>
<p>\[ 220 \leq 240 \]</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=solving-example-1-with-python>Solving example 1 with python</h2>
<p>For solving this problem with python we are going to use <code>PuLP</code>. To setup <code>PuLP</code> on
Debian is easy, just <code>pip3 install pulp</code> and that is it. If you are using <code>Poetry</code>,
just run <code>poetry add pulp</code>, or if you are using the <code>Poetry</code> setup in this
repository, it is already installed.</p>
<h3 id=modeling-the-problem>Modeling the problem</h3>
<p>For modeling this problem using <code>PuLP</code> basically we will need to import it and
create a problem:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=color:#f92672>import</span> pulp

</code></pre></div><p>Then we can add our variables to the problem, note that the restrictions based
on variable values are mapped here, so the non negativity rule and all others
based on the range of values should be applied at this point.</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimum bound of a variable is defined by the <code>lowBound</code> parameter.</li>
<li>The maximum bound of a variable is defined by the <code>upBound</code> parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Continuing our example, to create the \(x\) and \(y\) variables</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python>x <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> pulp<span style=color:#f92672>.</span>LpVariable(<span style=color:#e6db74>&#39;x&#39;</span>, lowBound<span style=color:#f92672>=</span><span style=color:#ae81ff>0</span>, cat<span style=color:#f92672>=</span><span style=color:#e6db74>&#39;Continuous&#39;</span>)

</code></pre></div><p>Now we define our objective function, we can write it as plain python code and
just <code>+=</code> it into the <code>problem</code> variable like this:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python>problem <span style=color:#f92672>+=</span> <span style=color:#ae81ff>600</span> <span style=color:#f92672>*</span> x <span style=color:#f92672>+</span> <span style=color:#ae81ff>800</span> <span style=color:#f92672>*</span> y, <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;Z&#34;</span>

</code></pre></div><h2 id=solving-the-example-1-by-hand-with-tableau-simplex-method>Solving the example 1 by hand with tableau simplex method</h2>
<p>To make it possible to solve a linear programming problem using the tableau
simplex method, the first thing to be done is to rearrange the problem into the
<strong>standard form</strong>.</p>
<h3 id=modeling-example-1-in-the-standard-form>Modeling example 1 in the standard form</h3>
<p>In the standard form <strong>restriction equations</strong> can&rsquo;t be written as inequalities, for
example \(x &lt;= 10\) is an inequality, and should be written as \(x = 10\). To make
this transformation valid, we have to add another variable to the equation, this
will be our <strong>slack variable</strong> \(fn\), so the equation will be rewritten as \(x + f1 =
10\).</p>
<p>If it is an \(\leq\) restriction, the \(fn\) variable is <strong>added</strong> to the equation, the
opposite is also true, if the restriction is a \(\geq\) restriction, the \(fn\)
variable is <strong>subtracted</strong> from the equation.</p>
<h4 id=in-case-of-a-subtraction>In case of a subtraction</h4>
<p>For every slack variable that is subtracted, an artificial variable should be
added \(a\) this variable is used to give an initial solution to the problem.
Also, an artificial objective function \(W\) should be added, which initially is
represented as:</p>
<p>\(W= a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + &mldr; + a_n\)</p>
<p>But before writing the \(W\) function we have to rewrite it as an expression using
the problem variables instead of the artificial variables.</p>
<p>For example consider 3 restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(3x + 1y - f1 + a1 = 12\)</li>
<li>\(3x + 4y - f2 + a2 = 30\)</li>
<li>\(2x + 7y - f3 + a3 = 28\)</li>
</ul>
<p>We isolate the artificial variable \(a\) as:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(a1 = 12 - 3x - 1y + f1\)</li>
<li>\(a2 = 30 - 3x - 4y + f2\)</li>
<li>\(a3 = 28 - 2x - 7y + f3\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the initial \(W = a1 + a2 + a3\) that will be rewritten as:</p>
<p>\(W = (12 - 3x -1y + f1)+(30 - 3x -4y +f2)+(28 -2x -7y +f3)\)</p>
<p>\(W = 70 -8x -12y + f1 + f2 + f3\) \(W + 8x + 12y -f1 -f2 -f3 = 70\)</p>
<p>Then the \(W\) objective function is used in the first phase of this resolution
instead of the original objective function \(Z\).</p>
<h4 id=continuing>Continuing</h4>
<p>All values presented in the right side of the equal sign must be constant, it
include the objective function \(Z\). So any term in any equation in the right
side that isn&rsquo;t constant should be transfered to the left side of the equation.</p>
<p>The restrictions can be translated into the following equations:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(x + y + f1 = 100\)</li>
<li>\(3x + 2y + f2 = 240\)</li>
<li>\(y + f4 = 80\)</li>
<li>\(x + f3 = 60\)</li>
<li>\(x,y,f1,f2,f3,f4 \geq 0\)</li>
</ul>
<p>With the objective function being translated into:</p>
<p>\(Z - 600x - 800y = 0\)</p>
<h3 id=table-modeling>Table modeling</h3>
<p>The tableau simplex method is based on tables, where each table represents a
possible solution to the problem, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that every table found is an
optimal solution for the problem, but <em>is a solution</em>. This table is called <strong>basic
feasible solution (BFS)</strong>.</p>
<p>For every table we will have variables with <em>positive values</em> called <strong>basic
variables</strong> and <em>null</em> variables (with their value being \(0\)) denominated <strong>non-basic
variables</strong>. <strong>The number of basic variables in a problem is equivalent to the
number of restrictions</strong>.</p>
<p>For every equation, the value in the <strong>right side of the equal sign is called
Right Hand value</strong>.</p>
<p>For every restriction, there will be a line in the table and after it another
line for the objective function \(Z\). The values of the <strong>non-basic</strong> variables will
be added accordingly with their respective values in the restriction that they
represent.</p>
<p>For this example, the first table will look like:</p>
<table>

<h3 id=table-solving>Table solving</h3>
<p>The initial table state is the initial problem state, where no action has been
taken, even solution will result in a new table after the calculations have
done. To determine if the current table is an optimal solution there are two
rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>No <strong>right hand</strong> value can be negative.</li>
<li>In the case of a <strong>maximization problem</strong>, no value in the objective \(Z\) line can
be negative. In the opposite case, a <strong>minimization problem</strong> the opposite is also
true, we have an optimal solution if we only have any \(n \leq 0\) values.</li>
</ul>
<p>The very first step to solve the table is to pick a <strong>pivot column</strong>, a column which
will be the base for the calculation of the next table. So we choose the column
(variable) that has more impact (has the smallest value) on the \(Z\) function, in
this case the \(y\) column where the impact is \(-800\).</p>
<p>The second step is to choose the <strong>pivot line</strong> which means <strong>which restriction will
be exhausted</strong>. So, for every value in the column, it will be checked against
every restriction to determine which one will result in more performance for the
\(Z\) function.</p>
<p>Using our example problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line 1, \(100 / 1 = 100\)</li>
<li>Line 2, \(240 / 2 = 120\)</li>
<li>Line 3, will generate a division by zero in the \(y\) column, it means that this
line and column combination won&rsquo;t affect the current situation.</li>
<li>Line 4, \(80 / 1 = 80\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Next step is define the <strong>pivotal line</strong>, this line means the best current move to
explore so we can archive the desired goal for our objective function \(Z\). The
line is chosen based on the smallest value on the list above, in this case, the
line 4 with the value \(80\).</p>

<p>After that, the next step is to <strong>divide</strong> the whole pivot line by the value on the
<strong>pivot column</strong>. And calculate the new values for the other lines by subtracting
the chosen variable, in this case \(y\) by the value that we set in the pivot
line, as following:</p>
<p>The new line 4 will be defined by \(NewLine4 = Line4 / y\), since \(y\) is 1, no
changes will happen.</p>
<p>Where \(y=1\), meaning the value in the intersection between the <strong>pivot line and
column</strong>. In the bellow examples, the \(y\) value mean the \(y\) value on the line of
the respective line being calculated and \(NewLine4\) is the value for that column
in the pivot line (Line 4).</p>
<ul>
<li>Line 1, \(NewLine1 = Line1 - y \times NewLine4\)</li>
<li>Line 2, \(NewLine2 = Line2 - y \times NewLine4\)</li>
<li>Line 3, \(NewLine3 = Line3 - y \times NewLine4\)</li>
<li>Line \(Z\), \(NewLineZ = LineZ - y \times NewLine4\)</li>

<h2 id=example-2>Example 2</h2>
<p>Since linear programming advances were due to the war, this example focus on the
following problem. Imagine that there is a tank production factory, where to
produce the tanks they need to cut some metal plates. Those plates come in 50cm
sheets, and can be cut in three ways, a 15cm cut, a 17.5cm cut and a 20cm cut.
The max allowed for any plates to be stored is 10 units per cut, it means that
if you can&rsquo;t produce 10 units of any measure above the required amount.</p>
<p>To finish the current tank is needed 32 plates of 15cm, 17 plates of 17.5cm and
21 plates of 20cm. How to cut the metal plates to minimize the loss and how many
metal plates will be needed ?</p>
